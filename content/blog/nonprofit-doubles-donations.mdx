## Meet Hearts for Hope

Hearts for Hope is a non-profit organization based in Denver, Colorado, dedicated to providing mental health support for underserved communities. Like many small non-profits, they operated on a tight budget with limited fundraising resources.

For five years, their annual fundraising strategy consisted of:
- Direct mail campaigns (response rate: 3%)
- Small in-person events (50-75 attendees)
- Corporate sponsorship requests
- Annual giving campaigns

Despite their important mission, they plateaued at around $85,000 in annual donations, barely enough to maintain operations and certainly not enough to expand their critical services.

## The Turning Point

In January 2024, Executive Director Maria Rodriguez attended a non-profit leadership conference where she heard about BIDWIN from another organization. Intrigued by their success story, she decided to try a different approach.

"We had nothing to lose," Maria explains. "Our traditional methods weren't scaling, and our community deserved better access to mental health services. We needed to try something new."

## The Strategy

Hearts for Hope partnered with BIDWIN to launch their first-ever online auction fundraiser with a unique twist: they themed it around wellness and self-care, perfectly aligned with their mission.

### Preparation Phase (3 Weeks)

**Week 1: Item Acquisition**
- Reached out to local wellness businesses (spas, yoga studios, fitness centers)
- Connected with therapists and counselors who donated consultation sessions
- Secured artwork from local artists who supported mental health awareness
- Gathered self-care packages and wellness retreat experiences

**Week 2: Digital Marketing**
- Created compelling social media content about mental health and giving
- Sent personalized emails to their 2,000-person mailing list
- Partnered with mental health influencers who shared the auction
- Created a video explaining how funds would directly impact community members

**Week 3: Final Push**
- Hosted Instagram Live previews of auction items
- Shared success stories from people helped by their services
- Built anticipation with countdown posts
- Mobilized board members to spread the word in their networks

### Auction Weekend

The auction ran from Friday evening through Sunday night - a 3-day window that accommodated different schedules and time zones.

**Innovative Engagement Tactics:**
- Mental health awareness content posted hourly
- Real-time impact updates: "Every $500 raised = 10 therapy sessions funded"
- Personal thank-you videos from beneficiaries (with permission)
- Interactive Q&A sessions about mental health resources

### Community Awareness
"The auction did more than raise money," Maria shares. "It started conversations about mental health. People who bid felt invested in our mission and became advocates, not just donors."

### Sustainable Growth Model
The success wasn't one-time. Hearts for Hope now runs quarterly themed auctions:
- **Spring**: Wellness & Renewal
- **Summer**: Family Mental Health
- **Fall**: Workplace Wellness
- **Winter**: Holiday Hope & Healing

Each auction continues to engage new supporters while deepening relationships with existing donors.

## Key Lessons from Hearts for Hope

### 1. Alignment Is Everything
"We didn't just auction random items," Maria explains. "Every item tied back to mental health, wellness, or self-care. This authentic connection resonated with our community."

### 2. Tell Your Impact Story
The most successful strategy was showing real-time impact. Updates like "This bid just funded 5 crisis counseling sessions" made giving tangible and meaningful.

### 3. Lower Barriers to Giving
Online auctions removed barriers that traditional events created:
- No need for childcare arrangements
- No travel to a venue
- No pressure of in-person fundraising asks
- Flexible participation times

### 4. Leverage Your Network
Board members became auction ambassadors, each personally reaching out to 25 contacts. This personal touch increased conversion rates by 340% compared to mass emails.

### 5. Make It Easy to Win
BIDWIN's mobile-friendly platform meant people could bid during their lunch break, while waiting in line, or relaxing at home. Convenience drove participation.

## The Long-Term Impact

One year after their first BIDWIN auction, Hearts for Hope has:

- **Tripled their annual budget** to $255,000
- **Served 400% more clients** than the previous year
- **Established recurring donor base** of 600+ people
- **Launched new programs** including youth services and crisis intervention
- **Become a model** for other mental health non-profits in the region

Maria reflects on the transformation: "BIDWIN gave us more than a fundraising tool. It gave us a voice, a community, and the resources to truly serve our mission. Lives are being changed because donors can easily support our work."

## Your Non-Profit Can Achieve This

Hearts for Hope's success demonstrates what's possible when mission meets modern fundraising tools:

- **Start Small**: You don't need hundreds of items - quality over quantity
- **Stay Authentic**: Align auction items with your mission
- **Tell Stories**: Share the impact of donations in real, human terms
- **Leverage Technology**: BIDWIN handles the complexity so you can focus on your mission
- **Build Community**: Every bidder is a potential long-term supporter
