## The Challenge

Riverside High School in Austin, Texas had a problem. Their athletic department desperately needed new equipment, the arts program was running on a shoestring budget, and their annual fundraising gala was barely breaking even.

"We were spending $8,000 on venue rental, catering, and logistics, and only netting about $15,000," explains Jennifer Martinez, the school's fundraising coordinator. "After three years of the same results, we knew something had to change."

## The BIDWIN Transformation

In March 2024, Riverside High decided to try something different. They partnered with BIDWIN to host their first-ever online auction weekend.

### The Setup Process

**Week 1: Planning**
- Created auction account in 15 minutes
- Uploaded 45 donated items with photos and descriptions
- Set auction dates for a Friday-Sunday window

**Week 2: Promotion**
- Shared auction link via email, social media, and school newsletters
- Created excitement with preview posts of featured items
- Engaged local businesses to donate items and spread the word

**Week 3: Launch**
- Auction went live Friday at 6 PM
- Real-time bidding began immediately
- Mobile notifications kept participants engaged throughout the weekend

### The Results Were Stunning

**Final Numbers:**
- **Total Raised**: $52,000
- **Number of Bidders**: 847
- **Items Sold**: 43 of 45 items
- **Average Bid Value**: $1,210
- **Event Costs**: $450 (BIDWIN platform fee only)
- **Net Profit**: $51,550

This represented a **344% increase** over their previous year's fundraiser.

## What Made It Work?

### 1. Extended Reach
"We had parents bidding from vacation, alumni from out of state, and even grandparents who couldn't attend physical events," Jennifer notes. "Our geographic limitation vanished."

### 2. Competitive Bidding
The real-time nature of BIDWIN created natural competition. The "VIP Dinner with the Principal" item, initially valued at $500, sold for $3,200 after an exciting bidding war between two parent groups.

### 3. Mobile Accessibility
87% of bids came from mobile devices. Parents could participate during their lunch breaks, while commuting, or relaxing at home - removing the barrier of requiring a specific time and place.

### 4. Transparency and Trust
Real-time leaderboards showed exactly how much was being raised, creating momentum and encouraging additional participation. "People could see we were approaching our $40,000 goal, and they pushed us over it," Jennifer recalls.

## The Items That Shined

**Top 5 Auction Items:**

1. **"Principal for a Day" Experience** - $3,200
2. **Exclusive Downtown Parking Spot (1 Year)** - $4,500
3. **Family Weekend at Lake Travis** - $2,800
4. **Private Art Class with Local Artist** - $1,900
5. **Season Tickets to School Events Package** - $2,100

"We learned that experiences and exclusivity sold better than physical items," Jennifer explains. "Parents valued unique opportunities over material goods."

## The Ripple Effect

The success of the auction had impacts beyond the money raised:

**Community Engagement**
- Reconnected with 120+ alumni who hadn't engaged in years
- Strengthened relationships with 15 local business sponsors
- Created new volunteer opportunities for tech-savvy parents

**Student Involvement**
- Photography students took item photos
- Marketing class created promotional materials
- Student government helped with item curation

**Ongoing Impact**
- New athletic equipment purchased
- Arts program expanded with 3 new courses
- Technology upgrades for 2 computer labs
- Established endowment fund with surplus

## Lessons Learned

Jennifer shares key insights from their experience:

### Start Early
"Give yourself 3-4 weeks for item collection and promotion. The more unique items, the better."

### Tell Stories
"Don't just list items - tell their story. Who donated it? Why is it special? What impact will purchases have?"

### Build Momentum
"We scheduled our auction to end Sunday evening when families are together. The final hour had 200+ active bidders creating incredible energy."

### Engage Your Community
"Make donors feel like heroes. We posted thank-you videos, shared real-time milestones, and celebrated every achievement publicly."

## Looking Ahead

Riverside High School is now planning their next BIDWIN auction with even bigger goals. They're targeting $75,000 for their next event and have already secured commitments from local businesses eager to participate.

"BIDWIN didn't just help us raise money," Jennifer reflects. "It transformed how our community connects with our school. We've discovered donors we never knew we had, and we've created a sustainable fundraising model that will support our students for years to come."
