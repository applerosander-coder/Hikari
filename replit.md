### User Preferences
I prefer the agent to be concise and to the point. When suggesting code changes, provide a brief explanation of the "why" behind the change, not just the "what." I value iterative development and prefer to review smaller, focused pull requests or changes rather than large, monolithic ones. Please ensure all modifications align with the existing monochrome design aesthetic (black, white, gray). Do not make changes to the `docs/` folder.

### System Architecture
The application is built on **Next.js 14 with the App Router** for routing and server-side rendering. **Supabase** handles the PostgreSQL database and user authentication. **Stripe** is integrated for payment processing, including features like auto-charge for saved cards and instant bidding.

**UI/UX Decisions:**
- **Color Scheme:** Strict monochrome palette (black, white, gray) is consistently applied across all UI elements.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized layouts for various screen sizes, ensuring mobile-friendliness with responsive text, image scaling, and adaptive components.
- **Interactive Elements:** Utilizes **Embla Carousel** for swipeable browsing and **Framer Motion** for animations, including a celebratory animation for successful bids. Sparkling glitter confetti with twinkling multi-color particles, rotating motion, and mouse-responsive parallax create a festive, celebratory aesthetic in the hero section.
- **Component Library:** Built with **Radix UI** primitives and styled using **Tailwind CSS**.
- **User Flow:** Includes email/password and GitHub OAuth authentication, a dashboard with personalized content (My Bids), and dedicated pages for auction browsing and bidding. Bid processing incorporates a payment flow with webhook verification and idempotency protection.

**Technical Implementations:**
- **Real-time Functionality:** Leverages Supabase's real-time subscriptions for live auction updates and countdown timers.
- **Database Schema:** Custom `auctions`, `bids`, `customers`, and `payments` tables manage auction items, user bids, and payment information.
- **State Management:** Uses **TanStack Query** for data fetching and caching, and **tRPC** for API communication.
- **Performance Optimizations:** Implements exponential backoff for polling, `router.refresh()` for targeted data fetching, and retry logic for bid verification to reduce client-side workload and improve responsiveness.
- **Deployment:** Configured for Replit Autoscale deployment.

**Feature Specifications:**
- **Live Auctions:** Real-time countdowns, dynamic bid updates, and categorized auction listings.
- **User Accounts:** Secure authentication, profile management, and avatar selection.
- **Payment Processing:** Integrated Stripe for secure bidding, managing saved payment methods, and off-session charging for auction winners.
- **Mobile Optimization:** Ensures accessibility and usability across all devices.
- **My Bids Page:** Dedicated section for users to track "Active Bids" and "Outbid" items with search functionality.
