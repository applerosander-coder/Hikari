# BidWin Auction Platform - Setup Instructions

## üéØ Welcome to BidWin!

Your SaaS template has been successfully transformed into a **live auction/bidding platform** where users can:
- Browse auctions with swipeable carousel interface
- See countdown timers for each auction
- Place bids on items and services
- View their active bids highlighted in the dashboard

## üìã Database Setup (Required)

### Step 1: Create Auction Tables

1. Open your [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy and paste the entire contents of `supabase_auction_schema.sql`
4. Click **Run** to create the tables

This will create:
- `auctions` table - Stores all auction items/services
- `bids` table - Stores all bids placed by users
- Automatic triggers and policies for security
- Real-time subscriptions for live updates

### Step 2: Add Mock Auction Data (Optional)

To populate your platform with sample auctions:

1. In Supabase SQL Editor, first get your user ID:
   ```sql
   SELECT id FROM auth.users LIMIT 1;
   ```

2. Copy the user ID you get back

3. Open `supabase_mock_auctions.sql` and replace `(SELECT id FROM auth.users LIMIT 1)` with your actual user ID if needed

4. Run the entire script to add 10 sample auctions:
   - Professional photography session
   - Vintage leather messenger bag
   - Web development package
   - Apple AirPods Pro
   - Fitness training
   - Designer sunglasses
   - Logo design package
   - Mechanical keyboard
   - Home cleaning service
   - Wireless headphones

## üöÄ How to Use the Platform

### API Endpoints

All data is accessed via Supabase:

- `supabase.from('bids').select('*')` - Get all bids
- Real-time subscriptions available for live updates

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Set up the database** using the SQL scripts provided
2. **Sign in** to your platform
3. **Visit `/dashboard`** to see the swipeable auction browser
4. **Place some bids** to see the highlighting feature
5. **Customize the styling** to match your brand
6. **Add auction creation** functionality for sellers
7. **Implement notifications** for when users are outbid

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**Issue**: "Could not find table 'auctions'"
- **Solution**: Run `supabase_auction_schema.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor

**Issue**: No auctions showing up
- **Solution**: Run `supabase_mock_auctions.sql` to add sample data, or create your own auctions

**Issue**: Can't see dashboard
- **Solution**: Make sure you're signed in first at `/signin`

**Issue**: Subscription errors in logs
- **Solution**: This is expected - we've removed the subscriptions table since this is now an auction platform, not a SaaS. The errors are harmless.
