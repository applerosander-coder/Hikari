    question: 'How does bidding work on BidWin?',
    answer:
      'Simply browse auctions, place your bid, and watch the real-time countdown. If you have the highest bid when time expires, you win! You\'ll receive a notification and instructions to complete your purchase.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Are there any fees to place bids?',
    answer:
      "Registration and browsing are completely free. You only pay when you win an auction. There are no hidden fees or bidding charges - what you bid is what you pay."
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I know the items are authentic?',
    answer:
      'All items are verified by our team before listing. We guarantee authenticity and quality. Items come with certificates of authenticity when applicable, and we offer buyer protection on all purchases.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens if I win an auction?',
    answer:
      'You\'ll receive an instant notification and email with payment instructions. Complete payment within 48 hours to secure your item. We accept all major payment methods and offer secure checkout.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I track auctions I\'m interested in?',
    answer:
      'Yes! Use the "My Bids" page to see all auctions you\'ve bid on with their current status and countdown timers. You can also save auctions to watch later and receive notifications before they end.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What if I change my mind after bidding?',
    answer:
      "Bids are binding once placed. However, if you haven't won yet, simply let the auction end without placing additional bids. We recommend bidding only on items you're committed to purchasing."
